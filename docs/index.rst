GraphLog documentation
====================================

`GraphLog <https://github.com/facebookresearch/graphlog>`__ is a multi-purpose, multi-relational graph dataset built using rules grounded in first-order logic. GraphLog can be used to benchmark existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) family of models on relation prediction task.
